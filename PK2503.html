      <h2 id="PK2503">Smart Expense Tracker with Anomaly Alerts</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Managing personal finances can be difficult, especially when unexpected or unusual transactions go unnoticed. Many people realize fraudulent activities or overspending only after significant loss. With the rise of digital payments, UPI, and SMS-based banking alerts, there is a strong need for intelligent tools that can help track expenses and flag unusual patterns automatically.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Current banking notifications, SMS alerts, and UPI alerts are passive and often fail to provide actionable, real-time insights. Users remain vulnerable to overspending or fraud because unusual spending patterns are not automatically analyzed or highlighted. Without an intelligent monitoring system, people may miss signs of fraud or fail to manage their finances effectively, leading to stress, financial mismanagement, or loss.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>Develop a personal finance app that automatically detects unusual spending patterns, integrates with SMS/UPI messages for auto-parsing, and aids in both fraud detection and expense management.</p>
