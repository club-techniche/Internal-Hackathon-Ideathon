      <h2 id="PKI2510"><u>Title:- Cybersecurity for IoT Devices</u>
</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>
   The Internet of Things (IoT) environment is highly vulnerable because smart devices often lack strong built-in security, use default passwords, and are difficult to update. This makes them easy targets for hackers, who can compromise a single device to hijack an entire network (e.g., launch a DDoS attack or steal personal data).
</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
<p>
  The system establishes a "normal" behavior baseline for every connected device (e.g., when a camera usually transmits data). By flagging any deviation as an anomaly, it provides real-time protection against cyber-threats, preventing data breaches and maintaining the physical security and privacy of homes and facilities.

</p>

<h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>
   Teams must address the high rate of false alarms (a device update can look like an attack), the need for the AI model to adapt quickly to new devices and user patterns, and the fragmentation of the IoT market, requiring the solution to work effectively across numerous device types and manufacturers.
