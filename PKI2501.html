      <h2 id="PKI2501"><u>Title:- Smart Soil Health Monitoring</u>
</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Healthy soil is the foundation of good farming. Crops need the right balance of nutrients and moisture to grow well, but many farmers rely on guesswork or outdated methods to decide when to water or add fertilizer. Smart soil health monitoring uses simple IoT (Internet of Things) devices to measure soil moisture, temperature, and key nutrients in real time, helping farmers make better decisions for higher yield and sustainable farming.</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
<p>Accurate soil data can reduce overuse of water and fertilizers, saving costs and protecting the environment. It supports climate-friendly farming, improves crop quality, and helps ensure food security for growing populations.</p>

<h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>Building affordable, easy-to-use sensors that work in different weather conditions is difficult. Farmers also need clear, simple reports they can understand without technical training. Reliable internet or power supply in rural areas can be another hurdle.
