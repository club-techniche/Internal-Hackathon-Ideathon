      <h2 id="PK2502">2. Smart Home Automation for Energy Efficiency and Safety</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Many homes are not energy-efficient and often lack systems to detect hazards, leading to unnecessary electricity consumption and potential accidents.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Traditional homes waste electricity because lights, fans, and appliances are left on unnecessarily, and they lack hazard detection systems for fire, gas leaks, or water overflow.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>Design a smart home automation system that automatically manages energy usage by controlling lights, fans, and appliances, while also detecting hazards like fire, gas leaks, or water overflow and alerting the homeowner.</p>
