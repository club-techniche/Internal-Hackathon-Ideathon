      <h2 id="PK2502">Smart Home Automation for Energy Efficiency and Safety</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Many homes are not energy-efficient and often lack systems to detect hazards, leading to unnecessary electricity consumption and potential accidents.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Traditional homes waste electricity because lights, fans, and appliances are left on unnecessarily, and they lack hazard detection systems for fire, gas leaks, or water overflow.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>Design a smart home automation system that automatically manages energy usage by controlling lights, fans, and appliances, while also detecting hazards like fire, gas leaks, or water overflow and alerting the homeowner.</p>      

<h3 id="hardware-clue">Hardware Clue (Just for reference no need to strictly use these components)</h3>
      <p>ESP32 (the main controller), relay modules (to switch appliances), and a variety of sensors like PIR (for motion), MQ-2 (for gas/smoke), flame sensor (for fire), and water level sensors (for leaks).</p>
