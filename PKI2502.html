</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Early detection is crucial for treating serious diseases like cancer and diabetic retinopathy (a retinal issue). However, specialist resources (radiologists, ophthalmologists) are scarce. AI-driven image recognition models can analyze medical scans (X-rays, fundus photos) to quickly spot minute anomalies, democratizing early screening.
</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
<p>It enables mass-scale, early screening in remote or resource-limited areas (Telemedicine), significantly increasing patient survival rates and preventing blindness. It also reduces the workload on specialists, allowing them to focus on complex cases.
</p>

<h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>Teams must address Algorithmic Bias (models may perform poorly on underrepresented populations), ensure patient data privacy (HIPAA/GDPR compliance), and tackle the "Black Box" issueâ€”providing clear, trustworthy explanations for AI-made diagnoses to doctors and patients.
