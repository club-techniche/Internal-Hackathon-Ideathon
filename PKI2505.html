      <h2 id="PKI2505"><u>Title:- Mental Health Chatbots</u>
</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>
   There is a global shortage of human mental health professionals, making care expensive and inaccessible. AI chatbots offer a scalable, anonymous, and immediately available solution to provide basic emotional support, help users track their mood patterns, and offer guided self-help exercises.

</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
<p>
  It drastically improves accessibility to basic support 24/7, helps destigmatize seeking help by offering anonymity, and allows for early intervention by flagging subtle, persistent mood changes. This is vital for overall student well-being.

</p>

<h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>
  The greatest risks are Safety and Harm (AI must never give dangerous advice, especially regarding crisis situations), maintaining Data Privacy (handling highly sensitive emotional records), and overcoming the Lack of Empathy to provide genuine, non-generic, and culturally sensitive support.
