      <h2 id="PK2508">Real-Time Disaster Response Coordination Platform</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Natural disasters often strike suddenly, causing widespread damage and distress. During such events, effective communication and coordination between rescue teams, emergency services, and affected communities are critical for saving lives and providing timely assistance. However, current disaster response efforts frequently suffer from inefficiencies, leading to delays in aid, misallocation of resources, and difficulty in reaching those in urgent need.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Existing systems struggle to consolidate real-time information from multiple sources, such as social media updates, reports from emergency services, and data from IoT sensors. This lack of an integrated platform makes it challenging to accurately map affected areas, prioritize rescue operations, and coordinate volunteers efficiently, resulting in slower response times and reduced effectiveness of relief efforts.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this challenge is to build a real-time disaster response coordination platform that aggregates data from social media, emergency services, and IoT sensors to create accurate maps of affected areas. The platform should help prioritize rescue operations, efficiently connect volunteers with people in need, and improve overall coordination during natural disasters. By providing timely and actionable insights, the platform can enhance disaster management, reduce response delays, and save lives.</p>
