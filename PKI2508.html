      <h2 id="PKI2508"><u>Title:- Child-Safe Internet Router Add-on</u>
</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>
   The digital world exposes children to inappropriate content (violence, adult material) and online risks (cyberbullying, addiction). While many routers have built-in controls, non-technical parents find them confusing, buried in technical settings, and ineffective for setting simple screen time or content rules across multiple devices.
</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
<p>
  The solution provides an intuitive, centralized tool for managing an entire home network, ensuring a safer digital environment for children. It promotes digital well-being by setting screen time limits and helps parents maintain a balanced, open discussion with their children about internet safety.
</p>

<h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>
  Teams must design an interface that is extremely simple for non-tech users (e.g., a "plug-and-play" app setup), ensure the filters are difficult for tech-savvy children to bypass (e.g., via VPNs or DNS changes), and manage privacy concerns around monitoring a child's browsing history.
