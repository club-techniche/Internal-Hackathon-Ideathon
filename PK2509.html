      <h2 id="PK2509">Haptic Navigator for the Visually Impaired</h2>
      <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
      <p>Navigating unfamiliar environments presents a significant challenge for individuals with visual impairments. Traditional navigation aids like the white cane are excellent for detecting immediate obstacles but offer no information about the broader route or direction to a destination. While smartphone GPS applications provide turn-by-turn audio directions, they can be problematic. They often require the user to hold and listen to a phone, which can be distracting, block out crucial environmental sounds (like traffic), and make the user feel more vulnerable in public spaces. Haptic technology—which communicates information through the sense of touch (e.g., vibrations)—offers a promising alternative. By translating directional cues into tactile feedback, it can provide a private, non-intrusive, and "heads-up" navigation experience.</p>

      <h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>Visually impaired individuals lack a navigation tool that provides intuitive, long-distance directional guidance without monopolizing their auditory sense or requiring constant interaction with a screen-based device. Current solutions force a trade-off between environmental awareness and navigational information, creating safety concerns and a cognitive burden for the user. There is a need for a seamless, screen-free system that can guide a user to a destination while allowing them to remain fully engaged with their immediate surroundings.</p>

      <h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
      <p>The goal of this project is to design and build a functional prototype of a handheld or wearable haptic navigation device for the visually impaired. This device will use GPS and a compass to determine the user's location and orientation, translating the path to a destination into simple, intuitive vibrational cues. The final prototype will demonstrate a "screen-free" navigation experience, offering a discrete and effective alternative to audio-based GPS systems.</p>      
      <h3 id="hardware-clue">Hardware Clue (Just for reference no need to strictly use these components)</h3>
      <p>ESP32, GPS module (like a NEO-6M), small vibration motors, a compass module (magnetometer) to know which way the user is facing.</p>
