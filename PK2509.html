      <h2 id="PK2509">Redesign urban spaces for inclusivity (e.g. accessibility for disabled people)</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Many urban areas in cities are not designed with accessibility in mind, making life difficult for people with disabilities. Wheelchair users, visually impaired individuals, and hearing-impaired people often face challenges accessing buildings, sidewalks, public transportation, and parks. These obstacles limit their independence and prevent them from fully participating in daily activities, education, work, and social life. Creating inclusive urban spaces is essential to ensure equality, safety, and convenience for all citizens.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Current urban infrastructure often lacks features such as ramps, tactile paths, audio and visual signals, wide doorways, and other inclusive facilities. Without these adaptations, disabled individuals encounter barriers that affect mobility, safety, and access to essential services, leaving them excluded from fully enjoying public spaces.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this hardware-focused challenge is to redesign or improve urban spaces to be accessible and inclusive for everyone. The project should incorporate physical modifications such as ramps, tactile paths, audio/visual signals, wider doorways, and inclusive public facilities to create safer, more convenient, and independent environments for people with disabilities. By implementing these solutions, the project aims to transform urban areas into spaces that accommodate all users and promote equal participation in society.</p>
