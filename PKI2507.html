</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>
   Marine pollution (oil spills, plastic waste) threatens marine life and coastal economies. Traditional monitoring is slow and localized. High-resolution satellite and aerial sensor imagery generates massive data, requiring AI to rapidly analyze, identify, and distinguish man-made pollutants (oil slicks, plastic patches) from natural features (seaweed, foam) over vast ocean areas.

</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
<p>
  It enables real-time, large-scale mapping of pollution hotspots, allowing authorities and cleanup crews to respond immediately and minimize ecological damage. It also provides evidence for legal action against polluters and helps track the global transport of plastic waste to inform policy.

</p>

<h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>
  Teams must figure out how to differentiate plastic from natural debris with high accuracy (the 'false positive' problem), ensure consistent data quality despite atmospheric interference (clouds, fog) and night-time operation, and establish global collaboration protocols for sharing satellite data and coordinating rapid interventions.
