</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Agriculture produces massive amounts of lignocellulosic waste (husk, straw, bagasse, peels) which is often burnt (causing pollution) or sent to landfills. This waste is a valuable, renewable resource that can be transformed into higher-value products like biofuel, compost, or eco-friendly materials. 
</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
<p>
  The project addresses environmental pollution by stopping open burning, creates new revenue streams for farmers and rural economies, and supports a circular bio-economy by replacing chemical inputs or virgin materials with sustainable alternatives.

</p>

<h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>Teams must devise solutions that are low-cost and easy to adopt by local communities, find efficient ways to collect, pre-process, and standardize diverse waste streams (rice husk vs. fruit peel), and ensure the quality and safety of the final upcycled product (e.g., animal feed, fertilizer).
