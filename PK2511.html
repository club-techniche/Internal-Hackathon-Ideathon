      <h2 id="PK2511">SensoDoor: The Smart Safety Stop That Guards Little Fingers</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Each year, thousands of children suffer from painful and sometimes permanently damaging finger injuries caused by closing doors. Young children, in particular, are often unaware of the danger posed by the hinge-side or latch-side gaps of a door. While manual safety products like foam stoppers exist, they are often forgotten, misplaced, or removed by adults for convenience, leaving children vulnerable to accidents. An automated, "always-on" solution could provide a much more reliable layer of protection.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Standard residential doors lack an integrated, automatic safety mechanism to detect and prevent a forceful closure when an object, such as a child's hand or finger, is in the doorjamb. This oversight leads to preventable, severe crushing injuries, as existing manual solutions are inconsistent and unreliable for constant protection.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The goal is to design and build a compact, affordable, and easy-to-install electronic safety gadget, the SensoDoor, that actively prevents door-related finger injuries. The system will use a sensor to detect any obstruction in the doorframe and will immediately deploy a physical stop to prevent the door from closing, thereby creating a consistently safe environment for children.</p>    

<h3 id="hardware-clue">Hardware Clue (Just for reference no need to strictly use these components)</h3>
      <p>The system is built around a small microcontroller that serves as the central processing unit, a non-contact proximity sensor to continuously monitor the hazardous space within the doorjamb, and a compact, fast-acting electronic actuator that physically engages to prevent the door from closing the moment an obstruction is detected.</p>
