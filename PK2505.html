      <h2 id="PK2505">5. Smart Interview Preparation Platform</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Many students preparing for campus placements lack realistic interview practice. While there are platforms that provide coding or HR questions, they do not simulate the real pressure of an interview or provide actionable feedback on performance. This gap makes it difficult for students to identify their weaknesses and improve before facing actual interviews.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Existing tools are limited to static question banks and do not provide an interactive interview experience. They fail to give instant, personalized feedback on coding skills, communication, or overall performance, leaving students underprepared for real placement scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The goal is to design and implement an AI-driven interview preparation tool that simulates real coding and HR interviews. The tool should dynamically ask relevant questions, provide instant feedback on answers, code quality, efficiency, and even voice or communication tone. It should track each student's performance over time, highlight areas for improvement, and offer personalized guidance to help them prepare effectively. The interface should be user-friendly, accessible anytime, and scalable so that students can practice realistic interviews repeatedly, building confidence and readiness for actual placement scenarios.</p>
