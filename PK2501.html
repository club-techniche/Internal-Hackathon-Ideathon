      <h2 id="PK2501">Inclusive Education Tool for Differently-Abled Students</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Education is a fundamental right, but many differently-abled students face barriers in accessing quality learning resources. Students with visual, hearing, mobility, or cognitive challenges often struggle in traditional classrooms because existing teaching tools are not designed with inclusivity in mind. Inclusive education tools can bridge this gap by leveraging technology to provide equal opportunities for learning, active participation, and academic growth for all students.</p>
