      <h2 id="PKI2504"><u>Title:- Community Seed Bank Platform</u>
</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Indigenous and traditional crop varieties, adapted to local climates and resistant to pests, are vital for resilient agriculture but are rapidly disappearing or are difficult to locate. Community Seed Banks (CSBs) preserve these, but their reach is limited. A digital platform can scale this critical preservation effort. 
</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
<p>
  It combats the loss of agri-biodiversity, provides farmers with climate-resilient genetic material for adaptation, and conserves traditional farming knowledge tied to each seed variety, thus boosting local food security and cultural heritage.
</p>

<h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>Teams must overcome the digital divide (designing for low-literacy/low-connectivity users, e.g., SMS-based systems), establish standards for accurate seed cataloguing (naming, traits), and ensure robust data governance to protect traditional knowledge from commercial exploitation.
