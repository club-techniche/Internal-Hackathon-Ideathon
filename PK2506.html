      <h2 id="PK2506">6. "Eco-Lens" - AI-Powered Sustainable Consumerism</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Consumers increasingly want to make environmentally friendly purchases, but determining the true sustainability of a product is often very difficult. Many products use misleading eco-friendly claims, a practice known as “greenwashing,” and complex supply chains make it hard to verify whether a product is genuinely sustainable. Additionally, the lack of transparent, easily accessible data turns ethical shopping into a time-consuming and frustrating process.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Current shopping methods do not provide consumers with real-time, reliable information about a product's environmental impact, leaving them unsure whether their choices are truly sustainable. This gap makes it challenging for people to support ethical brands and make environmentally conscious decisions effectively.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The goal is to create a mobile application that empowers consumers to make instant, informed, and sustainable choices while shopping. The app should provide clear information about a product's environmental footprint, materials, and supply chain practices, helping users identify genuinely eco-friendly products. By reducing confusion caused by greenwashing and lack of transparency, the app will make ethical shopping faster, simpler, and more reliable, encouraging responsible consumption and promoting sustainability.</p>
