      <h2 id="PK2512">Low-Code AI Platforms: Simplify AI/ML model building for non-programmers
</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are becoming essential in fields such as healthcare, finance, retail, and education. However, building AI/ML models usually requires strong programming skills and deep technical knowledge, which limits access for business analysts, domain experts, educators, and other non-programmers who have valuable data and insights but lack coding experience. Low-code and no-code technologies have shown that complex software can be created through visual interfaces and drag-and-drop tools, opening doors for wider participation in software development. Applying this concept to AI/ML can democratize innovation by allowing anyone with data and domain knowledge to create and deploy intelligent solutions.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Most existing AI and ML development platforms demand expertise in coding languages, data preprocessing, and algorithm tuning. This creates a steep learning curve and excludes many people who could otherwise design impactful AI solutions for their own fields. Small businesses, educators, and community organizations often have the data and use-cases but cannot afford to hire specialized developers. There is a clear need for a user-friendly platform that abstracts the technical complexity while still enabling powerful AI/ML model creation, training, and deployment.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this challenge is to design and prototype a low-code AI platform that lets non-programmers build, train, and deploy machine-learning models with minimal coding. The platform should provide an intuitive drag-and-drop or visual interface for tasks like data import, cleaning, model selection, training, and performance monitoring. It should also generate clear reports and allow easy integration of the trained models into real-world applications. By lowering the barrier to entry, the solution will empower a wider range of users to apply AI/ML to their own problems and encourage innovation across industries.
