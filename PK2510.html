      <h2 id="PK2510">10. Waste Segregation Monitoring System for Urban Local Bodies</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>In many cities, garbage is not properly segregated into wet waste, dry waste, and recyclable materials, which makes recycling difficult, increases the load on landfills, and contributes to environmental pollution. Urban local bodies and municipalities often lack an efficient, real-time way to monitor whether citizens are following waste segregation rules, leading to ineffective waste management and lower recycling rates.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Current systems do not provide live feedback or alerts about improper segregation, which results in continued mixing of waste and missed opportunities to improve environmental practices. Without proper monitoring, citizens may not be motivated to follow segregation guidelines, and local authorities struggle to enforce rules effectively.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this hardware-focused challenge is to develop a Waste Segregation Monitoring System that can monitor waste bins and detect whether garbage is segregated correctly. The system should send alerts or reports to local authorities when segregation rules are not followed and encourage citizens to dispose of waste properly. By improving compliance with segregation practices, this system aims to enhance recycling efficiency, reduce pollution, and promote better urban waste management.</p>
