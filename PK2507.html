      <h2 id="PK2507">7. Energy Consumption Tracker for Households</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Household energy consumption accounts for a significant portion of global energy use and carbon emissions. Many people are unaware of how much energy their daily activities consume or which appliances contribute most to their electricity bills. This lack of awareness often leads to inefficient energy use, higher costs, and a larger environmental footprint. With growing concerns about climate change and rising energy prices, it is crucial to empower individuals to understand and manage their energy consumption effectively.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>Current households lack tools that provide real-time monitoring and actionable insights on energy usage. Without clear information, people cannot easily identify ways to save electricity, reduce costs, or lower their environmental impact. This gap contributes to unnecessary energy waste and missed opportunities for adopting sustainable living habits.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>The goal of this challenge is to build a simple, user-friendly tool that monitors and visualizes household energy use, provides personalized tips to reduce consumption, and helps households lower their carbon footprint. By encouraging energy-efficient behavior, the tool should help people save money, reduce environmental impact, and promote sustainable living practices.</p>
