      <h2 id="PK2504">4. Virtual Campus Helpdesk (Chatbot + Knowledge Base)</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>University staff often receive a large volume of repetitive queries from students about admissions, placements, scholarships, and general campus facilities. Handling these queries manually takes a lot of time and effort, leading to delays in responses and reducing staff efficiency. With the increasing number of students and the need for quick answers, universities face a challenge in managing student communication effectively.</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>The current system relies heavily on emails, phone calls, or in-person queries, which overload staff and result in slow responses to frequently asked questions. This inefficiency affects both students, who wait longer for answers, and staff, who spend too much time on repetitive tasks instead of focusing on more critical work.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>Design and implement a virtual helpdesk chatbot that is trained on university FAQs covering admissions, placements, scholarships, and campus facilities. The chatbot should be able to provide instant, accurate responses 24x7, reduce email and query overload for staff, and leverage NLP and a web backend for intelligent interaction. The solution should be user-friendly, scalable, and capable of handling medium complexity tasks automatically to improve overall efficiency in student support services.</p>
