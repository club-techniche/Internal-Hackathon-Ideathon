      <h2 id="PKI2506"><u>Title:- IoT-Based Energy Monitoring for Marine Vessels</u>
</h2>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>
   The global shipping industry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and fuel costs. Marine vessels use large amounts of power for propulsion, cooling, and cargo handling. IoT (Internet of Things) involves using sensors on key equipment (engines, pumps, generators) to capture real-time data, which is necessary for optimizing energy use and meeting strict international COâ‚‚ emission regulations (like IMO's EEXI/CII).

</p>

<h3 id="importance">Importance</h3>
<p>
  The system drives significant cost reduction by optimizing fuel consumption, ensuring compliance with mandatory international environmental standards, and enabling predictive maintenance by detecting anomalies in machinery before critical failure, thereby enhancing safety and operational efficiency.

</p>

<h3 id="Challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>
  Teams must address ensuring reliable connectivity and data transmission while the vessel is at sea (beyond typical Wi-Fi range), developing rugged, low-maintenance sensors that can withstand the harsh, corrosive marine environment, and building secure platforms that protect sensitive operational data from cyberattacks.
